# SNN based on lif model in erlang
This is an erlang implementation of spiking neural network. Our main traget is to develop a network that can determine between X and O.
In future work, we want to use Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) algorithm in order to train our model to identify more items.

The equations we will be based on this article:

Here is an example of the system in matlab:
